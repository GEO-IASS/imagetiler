-- Zoom levels --

Zoom level 0 shows the entire image as one 256x256 tile. Subsequent zoom levels double both the horizontal and vertical sides.


-- How to use --

From the command line:

ruby tile_image.rb -o OUTPUT_DIR -z ZOOM_LEVELS IMAGE_FILE
For example
ruby tile_image.rb -o ./tiles -z 2..4 ./input_files/map.jpg


From ruby:
require 'tile_image'
Tiler::get_tiles(output_dir_name, image_file_name, zoom_levels, bg_fill_color [supposed to be transparent by default], format = "jpg")
e.g.
get_tiles("./tiles", "./input_files/map.jpg", 2..4)


-- Output --
Tiles in the output folder with format
#{output_dir}/tile_#{zoom_level}_#{tile_col}_#{tile_row}.#{image_format}


-- Other things --
* You need the rmagick gem.
* The output directory has to exist already.


-- Credits --
This tiler is based off of Guilhem's tile_image.rb tool in the ym4r project. The Tiler itself has been re-written, and TileParam is no longer used.
Thanks to Guilhem for the command-line portions and the sample ruby and rmagick code!
